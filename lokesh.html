                HAPPY BIRTHDAY LOKESH &#127881;<br>
                I am not sure how to start<br>
                But i could vibe with you the moment we met<br>
                and that night when you said you like me,<br>
                 among the girls in the room in truth or dare game<br>
                  i decided you will be my good friend ,
                  and then when we both hated nithin &#128517;<br> i was like omg how can we hate the same person &#128517;<br>
                  taravatha we didn't talk too much <br>
                  later when i asked you to come sit with me down for studying, that day you came down it was good i taught of talking so much but i couldn't<br>
                  taravatha the most walk i liked was when we went out thssat day after you were drunk<br>
                  I enjoyed talking to you<br>
                  and then the night you me chandhana danced that was also good i spent time with my two fav people &#129505;<br>
                  taravatha we never spoke I guess but i had so many things to tell you <br>
